No longer tasks to follow, \n\t\t\t\t\twith super specific instructions, but that you could actually implement whatever and however you wanted right now. I started by building a rough React frontside for the project, following very quickly with \n\t\t\t\t\tredux infused state containment before moving on to the backend. For the back I wanted to go for Node.js with Express framework, that I've got to practice during the course as well, but also picking up \n\t\t\t\t\tSocket.io to handle the connections between users and the server. It took a little time to get to know Socket.io, but proved itself really worth it.

After 125 hours of sometimes pleasant ride, but the other half being the bumpy sweat and tears ride, I can say it was totally worth it. My understanding of web development is on a \n\t\t\t\t\tcompletely new higher level, whilst my skills with the use of JS have risen incredibly. I've got to known the beauties of React and Redux, with competent use of Node.js with Express for the backend \n\t\t\t\t\tside development as well.","During the fullstackopen, I was tasked to make several smaller pages filling few requirements to show off that I've learned those things.
